                            <p>This work was submitted to the <a href="https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/popularitychallenge/">IEEE ICIP 2020 Image Popularity Prediciton Challenge </a>. The submitted work deals with the problem of attempting to predict the popularity of images before even being uploaded. This method is specifically focused on Flickr images. Social features of each image as well as that of the user who had uploaded it, have been recorded. The dataset also includes the engagement score of each image which is the ground truth value of the views obtained by each image over a period of 30 days.

                            The work aims to predict the popularity of images on Flickr over a period of 30 days using the social features of the user and the image, as well as the visual features of the images. The method states that the engagement sequence of an image can be said to depend on two independent quantities, namely scale and shape of an image. Once the shape and scale of an image have been predicted, combining them the predicted sequence of an image over 30 days is obtained.The current work follows a previous work done in the same direction, with certain speculations and suggestions of improvement.

                            <p>This work has been accepted at the<a href="https://www.icdsmla.com/"> ICDSMLA 2020 </a> but is yet to be published.  Bridge health monitoring using machine learning tools has become an	efficient and cost- effective approach in recent times. In the present study, strains in railway bridge member, available from a previous study conducted by IIT Guwahati has been utilized. These strain data were collected from an existing bridge while trains were passing over the bridge. LSTM is used to train the network and to predict strains in different members of the railway bridge. Actual field data has been used for the purpose of predicting strain in different members using strain data from a single member, yet it has been observed that they are quite agreeable to those of ground truth values. This is in-spite of the fact that a lot of noise existed
							in the data, thus showing the efficacy of LSTM in training and predicting even from noisy field data. This may easily open up the possibility of collecting data from the bridge with a much lesser number of sensors and predicting the strain data in other members through LSTM network.</p><a href="https://github.com/BakaZoro/ICDSMLA2020_BridgeHealthMonioring/blob/main/ICDSMLA_IIITG.pdf"> Link to the paper</a>.

The work has been accepted under the ICPR Workshops and Challenges, but is yet to be published.  Endoscopy is a very important procedure in the medical field. It is used to detect almost any diseases associated with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Hence, the current work attempts to use Machine learning methods such that such medical procedures can be automated and used in real-time to ensure the proper diagnosis of patients. The current work implements the Tiny Darknet model with an attempt to efficiently classify the various medical conditions specified in the dataset used. Eventually, the Tiny Darknet succeeds in achieving a high classification speed, achieving up to a maximum speed of about 60fps.</p><a href="https://github.com/BakaZoro/ICPR2020_EndotectSubmission/blob/main/Spearheads_ICPR_EndoTect_2020.pdf"> Link to the paper</a>.

                            <p>I am a singer and also the percussionist of our college formed band. I was a former coordinator of our College Music Club. Our band is called Ataasi, which translates to "Not discriminating between any form of music". We have performed live on a few occasions and have also won a <strong>Nation-Wide </strong> band competition. When all of us manage to have some time, we spend time jamming and relaxing.
